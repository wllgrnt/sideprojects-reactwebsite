# ReactWebsite

This repo provides the website hosted at [wpg.io](https://wpg.io), a basic vanity page built using Gatsby. The project is intended to be a learning exercise, and is likely to contain anti-patterns and bad software engineering. pull requests and comments welcome!



### Still to-do:

- [ ]  Add section on PhD
- [ ]  Add blog section
- [ ]  Add d3.js examples
- [ ]  More side projects
- [ ]  Add CV
- [ ]  Enumerate website goals, update README
- [ ] Unit tests


### Website requirements

- Lightweight: it's only a vanity page/cv/list of hobby projects, I shouldn't force anyone to download megabytes of cruft to look at it.
- Integrated with D3: lots of my viz work is in D3, and it'd be good to host that directly.
- Modern: this whole project is a learning exercise, so I might as well learn the current web-dev dogma.
- CRUD interface? It'd be good if I could learn how to roll my own CRUD service, for blogging/further websites.
- PWA: I plan to make an app with React-Native, but making a progressive web app that works nicely on mobile and that could be deployed on the app store might be better?

### Tech Stack

-  Gatsby

- Namecheap Hosting

- - Cheap and secure, with whois masking, though currently I can only host static websites (which I believe Github would do for free).
